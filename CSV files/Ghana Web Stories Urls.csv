According to her, the lottery agent added other people as her family instead of her own. She revealed that she lived unhappily for years, and loneliness may have been the cause of her husband’s death.

In a chat on SVTV Africa’s Daily Hustle Worldwide, the widow revealed that she never for once saw her ‘family’ after she arrived in the US. Moreover, she tried countless times to file for her husband and kids to join her, but it was not successful.

“Initially, I didn’t want to go because I had to leave without any of my six children or my husband. I got the visa in May, but I left in August. They had to convince me first. Living in America has been sad for me,” she disclosed. 

Miss Boampong added that her husband had stroke seven months after she left Ghana, but he got better. 

“We were very close. My husband and I went everywhere together. He could not join me before his death because there were errors in some of the documents. He died a few months after they denied him,” she added. 

According to the 68-year-old, her last born is the only one living with her, “but the others are still in the pipeline. There is no joy in my life at the moment.”"

He said Atwima and Murnau would work together to develop more projects and figure out strategies and ideas that would impact positively on them

Among key areas he said would be considered were the area of health,  education, exchange programs, firefighting, infrastructural development, and sharing of culture and tradition.

Mayor Beuting was speaking at the Municipal Council at Markt Murnau a Stafelsee, when their sister town Atwima, led by Atwima hene, Nana Antwi Agyei Brempong II, called on them.

The visit was aimed at deliberating on how best the two cities could work together to bring rapid development to their communities and also letting each other know about the developmental projects that were already in place.

The visit was also to enable the team from Atwima witness the famous Oberammergau Passion Play of the Passion of Jesus,  a special play shown every 10 years, which seeks to convey the message of passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

The play was in appreciation to God for healing Bavaria and Swabia from an Infectious disease that struck them in 1631

The first visit was in 2019 when Nana Antwi Brempong and Mr. Beuting signed a sister-partnership agreement between the two towns, which was characterized by a cultural festival.

According to the Atwima hene, this move was his contribution towards climate change and saving the next generation from its negative effects.

Additionally, he has ordered all households to plant trees in front of their houses and he has taken the lead as leadership by example.

In a chat on SVTV Africa, Agatha, however, mentioned that Turkey is best for people who wish to transact import and export business. She indicated that the Turkish economy keeps receding and will not encourage people to travel there for work.

“Turkey was good some eight years when I came here, but now, the economy keeps receding. It’s getting worse. So I don’t think I can stay here anymore,” she said on Daily Hustle Worldwide.

According to her, many Ghanaians are stranded in Turkey because the travel agents lie to them. Many of them do not have working permits. They live on the streets and in ghettos. 

“But it is good if you come here for business. If you want to import clothes or other products to Ghana, you're good. Factory employees work 12 to 14 hours a day, but the salary is not enough,” she told DJ Nyaami.

Miss Agatha advised the youth who plan to travel for work to change their mindset about working in Ghana. According to her, many jobs are available, but the income is not favorable. 

“Some people have jobs and live well, but they still want to travel. Such persons shouldn't travel unless for business. Turkey is not the place to stay and work,” Agatha opined."

In an interview on Daily Hustle Worldwide, Kwame sympathized with Ghanaians who make GH¢1500 monthly, and complained about the high cost of living in Ghana, presently.

According to Kwame, he bought a pack of rice for GH¢25 in 2021, but he could not finish it. In 2022, Kwame Case said he bought the same pack for GH¢40, and he was not satisfied. 

“I came to Ghana with a budget but I overspent. Fuel, water, everything is expensive. I don’t know whether it is the air that they pump as fuel for us these days. I spent GH¢400 on fuel almost every day. 

Ghana is expensive. I feel sorry for some people living in Ghana because some are doing well, but what about those making GH¢1500 a month with a family of four. How will they survive?,” Kwame quizzed.

Moreover, Kwame stated that he could never survive on a GH¢15,000 salary in Ghana at this rate. He mentioned that Ghana has become a place for the rich.

“Ghana is a good place to live if you own a company. If you live on hand-to-mouth, then you better find a way out.”

5,"Abroad, Ghanaians","Diasporia News of Wednesday,  1 June 2022",2022-06-01,Queen Elizabeth recognises Ghanaian volunteer with Commonwealth Points of Light Award,"Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Head of the Commonwealth, has recognised Mr Eric Asamoah Awuah, representing Ghana, as the 221st Commonwealth Point of Light.

A statement issued by the British High Commission in Accra, copied to the Ghana News Agency said the award was in honour of Mr Awuah for his exceptional voluntary service engaging thousands of school pupils in debating and critical thinking.

It said Mr Awuah, aged 32, is a debate and communications coach who created ‘Speech Forces’, an organisation which had engaged over 30,000 school pupils in Ghana, Nigeria and other African countries in critical thinking and public speaking programmes.

It said Mr Awuah set up the organisation in 2014 with the aim of empowering young people to better express themselves and to support their personal development alongside their studies at school.

The statement said the initiative hosts major international debate events, such as its flagship Accra Open, and since 2017 has managed the Ghana National Debate Team, training selected high school students from all over Ghana to participate in events including the World Schools Debate Championship.

It said as part of the legacy of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London 2018, The Queen - as Head of the Commonwealth - was thanking inspirational volunteers across the 54 Commonwealth nations for the difference they are making in their communities and beyond, by recognising one volunteer from each Commonwealth country every week.

It said by sharing these stories of service, the Commonwealth Points of Light awards celebrate inspirational acts of volunteering across the Commonwealth and help inspire others to make their own contribution to tackling some of the greatest social challenges of our time.

Mr Awuah said: “I am honoured to be this year’s recipient of the Points of Light Award in Ghana.

""Our work at 'Speech Forces' - of which I am privileged to lead - empowers young people of all backgrounds to think critically on issues, appreciate differences in perspectives in the quest to developing thoughtful leaders and active citizens in Africa.



""I receive this recognition on behalf of all the volunteers, sponsors and curious young minds who have kept the mission moving.

""My sincere appreciation to The Queen and the British High Commission of Ghana for recognizing our efforts.”

Madam Harriet Thompson, the British High Commissioner to Ghana, said: “The Points of Light award is given to the truly inspirational working amongst us on projects that impact our communities; so often these people silently do exceptional things and today we have been able to celebrate them properly"".

“It was my honour and delight to award Eric, the founder of Speech Forces, the 221st Commonwealth Point of Light award on behalf of The Queen.

""Their work to support young people across West Africa to feel able really to express themselves has changed lives as these same young people go on to further education, internships and careers feeling empowered and confident.”

The statement said the Commonwealth was a diverse community of 54 nations, that work together to promote prosperity, democracy and peace.

It said the Heads of Government meeting brought together leaders from all the 54 Member countries to reaffirm common values, address shared global challenges and agree how to work to create a better future for all citizens, especially young people.

It said Voluntary service was a vital part of this agenda, which was why The Queen had chosen to recognise outstanding volunteers across the Commonwealth in this special way.

The Points of Light awards recognise outstanding volunteers every day of the week – people whose service is making a difference in their communities and whose story can inspire others to creative innovative solutions to social challenges in their own communities and beyond."
6,"Abroad, Ghanaians","Diasporia News of Tuesday, 31 May 2022",2022-05-31,Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa addresses NDC Holland chapter town-hall meeting,"Theme: Ghana’s Hung Parliament and the role of the Minority

NDC Holland Chapter held a mini-Town Hall Meeting in Amsterdam on May 28, 2022. The main guest speaker was Honourable Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, a Member of Parliament for North Tongu in the Volta Region of Ghana. Other invited guests were Honourable Alex Segbefia, the NDC Director of International Relations, and his deputy Dr Karl-Mark Arhin. 

Honourable Alex Segbefia was unable to attend the event as he was otherwise engaged. More than 50 NDC members from around the world attended this Town Hall Meeting via Zoom while members who gathered at the Town Hall in Amsterdam numbered 75.

NDC Holland Chairman Fred Morgan and his Secretary Mubaraq Huseini were the moderators of the event. Our first speaker was Dr Karl-Mark Arhin who spoke about the important role played by the Diaspora since the establishment of the National Democratic Congress some 30 years ago. 

He reiterated the need for the Diaspora to continue to support the party in their homeland as they have done in the past. He also said that they must be vigilant in case the Election Commission intends to roll out ROPA in the 2024 general elections. 

Dr Arhin indicated that EC might replace the Ghana Card with the Voters' Card. He stressed that the intention of EC to do so is a devilish plan because allegedly, the National Identification Authority is denying some areas in Ghana to register for the Ghana Card. And most of these areas are where the NDC has its stronghold. 

For this reason, the party headquarters has directed all branch executives to encourage their members between the ages of 16 and 25 to register for their Ghana Card. He also emphasised that the 2024 general election is going to be ""boot for boot"" as stated by His Excellency, incoming Flagbearer John Dramani Mahama. 

By this, he meant that NDC will protect the ballot boxes at polling stations during the 2024 general elections and will also be vigilant during the compilation and transmission of the results.

The guest of honour was in Tamale to mark the 10th anniversary of the death of our former president, Professor John Evans Atta Mills. He spoke to the gathering on Zoom on the topic of “Ghana's Hung Parliament and the Role of the Minority”.

Honourable Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa commended the NDC members in the Diaspora and admitted that he has always had great admiration for the NDC in the Netherlands and assured the Chairman that he would visit them if they would invite him.

Honourable Ablakwa clarified that there is no such thing as a majority in the 8th Ghanaian Parliament. The parliament consists of 137 MPs from the NDC side and 137 MPs from the NPP side. However, there is an independent MP who decided to vote to support NPP, but he is not an NPP member. 

And if that independent MP wanted to cross the carpet to join the NPP and give it to the majority, then he should give up his seat and seek by-election to contest on the ticket of NPP. But as long as he is an independent MP, there is no majority party in parliament.

He commended the NDC for its role in the passage of the 1992 Constitution, the longest standing constitution that has made our stable democracy possible over the past 30 years. He expressed sadness over the brutal killings of party supporters in Techiman South and other places during the 2020 general elections, saying Ghana is being ruled by a callous president who does not care about the needs of Ghanaians. 

He said the President does not care whether the people of SALL are represented or not. He stressed that they have been on the side opposing the passage of the E-Levy and that is why they are going to court to challenge this odious and oppressive tax imposed on Ghanaians. 

Although they did not win the injunction to stop the E-Levy, the Supreme Court admonished GRA to keep all records of the amounts collected while the case is in court. He did not mince words, calling the government led by President Akufo-Addo the most corrupt government in Ghana's history. 

To support his arguments, Honourable Ablakwa mentioned the Oslo Chancellery scandal he uncovered; exposing the president's lavish foreign trips where he rented private jets for $18,000 an hour, and the Ghc242 million earmarked in the 2022 budget for the collection of the E-Levy which would have gone to an unknown company. 

He also said that they have put strong pressure on the government to account for the Covid-19 funds for which the Speaker of the House has called on his Finance Minister to account for the Covid-19 Fud. He also revealed that the President has appointed 337 non-political staff in the Office of the President, including a Church Relations Manager, a Diaspora Church Manager, and a Diaspora Youth Ambassador. 

Honourable believes these appointees are needless and a waste of taxpayers’ money. After taking credit for not wasting money in appointing Deputy Regional Ministers, President Akufo-Addo made a U-turn and appointed Special Assistants to Regional Ministers, to the chagrin of Ghanaians.

On the Achimota Forest saga, the Honourable Member opined that the Owoo Family does not exist anywhere. The name was created by the NPP under ex-President JA Kufuor - the NPP under President Nana Akufo-Addo wants to loot, divide and share the land. It is therefore not surprising that the late Kwadwo Owusu Sekyere had various plots of land in his will. 

He also assured the NDC Holland Chapter members and all NDC members that they will not put to rest the security breaches with regard to Madam Evelyn Aidoo (aka Serwaa Broni) case. They believe the President abused his office by using the State’s Security apparatus to jeopardise the lady’s life. 

The case of Ms Evelyn Aidoo speaks very bad about the President among the international community the President gave easy access to her onboard the President Jet and her unprotected contact with the lady is much to be worried about. And although they do not have the majority to remove the President, they have the numbers to start an impeachment process against the President.

In conclusion, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa expressed concern about the corruption and state capture institutionalised under President Akufo-Addo. He said that the skyrocketing inflation of almost 26% and the sharp depreciation of the Ghanaian Cedi against foreign currencies were also worrisome. He pointed out that Ghana is moving in the wrong direction and that only the NDC can save the country from a deep fall.

In a chat on SVTV Africa, Mr. Quartey mentioned that his ex-wife gave him pressure to marry her because he had a government job and a house soon to be his. However, he could not agree to the marriage because he did not have a residence permit. 

“She asked for my card, drove to a nearby police station, and parked at a no parking area. The police came and asked for ID, but she gave them mine instead. It was deliberate.”

""Two years later, I was deported to Ghana and that was in 2009, but I had two boys with her. They were about 2 and 3 years old when I was deported,” he told DJ Nyaami.

13,"Abroad, Ghanaians","Diasporia News of Thursday, 26 May 2022",2022-05-26,Ghanaian female doctor receives award in Public Health from Harvard,"Across several ethnic groups in Ghana, women go through a set of rites and rituals as part of the funeral rites of their dead husbands. The practice of widowhood rites is particularly very onerous on women. 

Among women living in and around Bolgatanga, in the Upper East Region of Ghana, the occurrence of widowhood rites is rife. The project aimed to learn about women’s experiences of widowhood rites, including the effects on their mental and physical well-being, and re-tell their stories in animated videos to serve as tools for advocacy. 

The study was a mixed-methods study carried out in the Bolgatanga Municipal district in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Every widow interviewed reported at least two mental health symptoms, with the majority having symptoms suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder. 

Several participants also reported impacts on their physical health, including sexually transmitted infections from sexual abuse during the performance of the rites. 

The broad themes deduced from the interviews and highlighted for creating the animations were: mental health effects; widow victimization; economic hardship engendered by property repossession; food insecurity of widows and their families; and sexual exploitation of these vulnerable women. 

Several of the different components of these rites constitute gender-based violence and must be modified or eliminated to protect the dignity of women in the communities in this region. Storytelling is the first step toward this change.

MOST REWARDING PART OF THE FIELD EXPERIENCE

""For me, the most rewarding aspects of my experience were the conversations I had with the women in the field. Even though conversations around violence and abuse are usually difficult ones to have, the widows I interviewed made it so easy. The conversations were thoughtful, thought-provoking, and had such depth that I came away with so many nuggets of wisdom,"" Sumbawiera said.

ADVICE FOR STUDENTS DOING WORK IN THE FIELD

""Very often, the people we seek to help know the solutions to their problems more than we ever would be able to appreciate. It is important to take a step back so they can step forward and reveal to us what they really need,"" she added."

In a chat on SVTV Africa with DJ Nyaami, Adwoa shared an experience working with a Ghanaian contractor living in Ghana. According to her, the contractor has been very truthful, and his honesty has won him several business contracts from her friends in the USA. 

“Doing business in Ghana is all about finding a trustworthy person. Fortunately for me, I met a contractor, and because of his honesty, I've introduced him to many people here. 

If you find an honest person, everything you do back home becomes a success. Most of us want to start businesses in Ghana, but sometimes they make it hard. Fortunately for me, I have honest people to take care of the business without any glitches,” she stated.

Speaking on life in the US, Serwaa advised young Ghanaians abroad to invest their money in education. According to her, life in the US is better off as literate than an illiterate. 

“Some people come abroad for fashion. We spend our money on expensive clothes, parties and all. Think about the future. Will you be able to do hard labor the rest of your life,” Adwoa quizzed."

However, he lost it soon after military personnel was dispatched to the mining areas in 2017.

In a chat on SVTV Africa, Cosmos mentioned that he went broke and had to sell off his machines to sponsor his journey to Europe. Moreover, Cosmos explained that he could not work anywhere in Ghana, hence his decision to travel. 

“The highest amount I made at the time was GH¢100,000. I couldn’t sleep till I deposited it at the bank. At the time, GH¢100,000 was nothing to galamseyers. Some had millions of cedis. Eventually, the soldiers came to destroy our machines. That was the end of me,” he said.

According to Cosmos, they invested a large sum of the money into machines. He added that he had rented excavators and pumping machines worth over GH¢60,000. 

“Someone might think I got all this money and lost it. You can’t put a small amount of money into a gold business. One excavator costs GHs300,000, and you would have to rent it for the job. I needed to invest in it and gain profit,” he told DJ Nyaami. 

Speaking about his thoughts on destroying water bodies, Cosmos mentioned that “we had to do was dig a hole and wash the gold in that and not the rivers, but the Chinese and the leaders were already destroying the rivers. As youths in the community, we did not want to look away while foreigners took away our gold.”"
