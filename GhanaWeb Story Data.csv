According to him, whites are ‘gods’ who need to be worshipped. 

In a chat on SVTV Africa, Mr. Annan mentioned that he sees white people as ‘gods’ because “the devil you know is better the angel you don’t know.” Mr. Annan indicated that they migrated from Libya in 1988 with no one to host him in Italy.

“If I see a white person on my way to church, I’ll go back home because I have seen Jesus. You will never get everything perfect in life, and we’ve heard a lot about them, but they care.

""They listened to us, accepted us, and gave us a place to stay. Later in 1990, they gave us a permit to stay,” he revealed.

Mr. Annan further lauded Italians as the best people in Europe. According to him, people pay large sums of money for permits, but they never get them.

“However, it is difficult to get certain jobs in Italy as a black person. If a position is vacant, they will wait till they find a white Italian. That’s why I moved my family to the UK in 2014,” he added. 

The father of five also shared his journey in the UK and how satisfying it has been living in England."

In a chat on Daily Hustle Worldwide, Kusiwaa indicated that she began her journey from South Africa before settling in Israel. According to her, despite her little success in SA, she decided to migrate for better job opportunities.

Speaking on documentation for migrants, Kusiwaa mentioned that Israeli immigration gives work permits to anyone who seeks refuge in the country. However, the immigration can scrap off the work permit anytime without prior notice. 

As a result, Madam Kusiwaa planned to work and build a home for herself and her children before she moves back to Ghana.

“If you are lucky, you can stay for six years before the permit is terminated. So I bought land for GHs20k after three months of working. It’s been three years, and I have built and roofed a ten-bedroom in Ghana.

""I do not want to live a flashy life here because you can’t go home and come back again. If they cancel my permit, I know I have a home to go to,” Kusiwaa said. 

The mother of four added that they do not rely on the work permit because it is not secure. Kusiwaa mentioned that there are many well-paying jobs in Israel. However, most of them are menial."

In a chat on ‘Daily Hustle Worldwide’ on SVTV Africa, Ali indicated that the immigration laws are so tight that foreign nationals find it tough to go back to their home countries, especially blacks. 

“No black person here has a residence permit. Even if you marry a Malaysian woman, you won’t get it. So we avoid immigration. For the past 30 years, I haven’t been to Ghana because I won’t be able to come back here."" 

The Ghana embassy has tried many times but to no avail. The situation is very different, even if you have the money to travel out,” he told DJ Nyaami. 

According to Ali, Malaysian immigration only gives residence permits to foreign nationals from neighboring countries. 

Speaking on how Malaysians relate to blacks, Mr. Ibrahim disclosed that “in terms of work, an Indonesian or Indian will get 160, but I will get 130 for the same job.”

Mr. Ali disclosed that it is more difficult for them to document blacks because of some Nigerians.

""Blacks in Malaysia do not have a good name because of what the Nigerians here do. They scam people a lot, so the Malaysians do not like us,” he added."

The naming ceremony is the brainchild of Black American tour operator Rashad McCrorey and coordinated by the people in the village of Iture.

The Ceremony

Issued by the elders of Iture and members of the Royal Family, the first names are chosen based on the day the individuals were born. The sex of the individuals and their birth order are factors considered when picking a surname. 

""For example, I am a third born male, born on a Friday, so my name is Kofi Mensah”, he told journalist Ella Okunmwendia. The ceremony started at the One Africa Health Resort, a resort built on an enstooled land in Iture by the former Safohen. 

In attendance were the King Iturehen, the Ebusuapanyin, the Queen Mother, the family elders, and high ranking members of the Royal Family. The ceremony kicked off with a discourse between the participants and officials before the pouring of libation. 

At the naming ceremony, the partakers received a cup of water and alcohol each, which symbolically represents good versus evil. They were then given their names and presented with a certificate. After the naming, the participants were marked with white clay to signify their victorious return. They also had neem leaves placed on their necks, symbolizing good health and luck. 

A New Journey

In a chat with journalist Ella Okunmwendia, Rashad McCrorey explained the importance of the traditional naming ceremony. He said, ""many Black Americans and Diasporans only know their European history, which begin with Slavery."" He described the naming ceremony as an intricate part of the learning process. ""Understanding that similar to astrology and horoscopes, the names based on day, number and quality also has influence on your life"", he added. 

For many Diasporans, the naming ceremony conveys a sense of belonging. This is due to the involvement of the entire village, the royal family, and the sub chiefs. ""Many have cried, smiled, and described the naming ceremony as the high point of their experience"", Rashad McCrorey told Ella Okunmwendia. Usually done after a visit to the slave dungeon, the naming ceremony  brings balance and a tilt toward the positive.

""You need to be smart, or you will live hand to mouth. You can’t stick to one thing. You will go hungry. Most people rent a room and share a bathroom and kitchen, but it’s not comfortable. It is better to get a well-paying job or a second job,” Danny told DJ Nyaami.

A press release signed by the communication officer of the NDC-UK and Ireland chapter Mr Simon Aworigo noted that the revelations by Madam Evelyn Serwaa Poku Aidoo also known as Serwaa Broni about the fallout from her alleged sexual relationship with President Akufo-Addo and her subsequent state-sponsored harassment by security operatives are very worrying, which needs to be fully investigated by appropriate security agencies. 

Serwaa Broni made the disclosure in an interview with Kelvin Ekow Taylor, a United States-based Ghanaian journalist, on Loud Silence Television.

Read the full press release Below:

THE NDC-UK & IRELAND CHAPTER CALLS FOR A FULL INVESTIGATION INTO THE PRESIDENT AKUFO ADDO - EVELYN AIDOO(SERWAA-BRONI) SCANDAL. 

The NDC UK and Ireland Chapter have noted with revulsion and disbelief the recent revelations by Evelyn Serwaa Poku Aidoo popularly known as Serwaa Broni in an interview she granted to the United States-based Ghanaian journalist Kevin Ekow Taylor on Loud Silence Television about the fallout from her alleged sexual relationship with President Akufo Addo and her subsequent state-sponsored harassment by security operatives.

At a time when Ghanaians are struggling with bad roads, a lack of beds at our health facilities where patients including babies and mothers sleep on the floor, high rate of unemployment and many more challenges that face us as a people for which he was elected, sadly President Akufo Addo once again brings dishonor to the high office he occupies and by extension the government he leads.

The Ghanaian economy has recently been downgraded by reputable international financial institutions for overborrowing and poor performance. 

Surprisingly, none of these weightier matters of national interest seem to be the primary preoccupation of our president but rather he uses the national security apparatus to cover up the fallouts from a scandal he has brought upon himself.

Evelyn Serwaa Broni Aidoo also alleged that she and her friend were harassed by National Security Operatives. She further alleges that a robbery was staged in an attempt to seize evidence of Akufo Addo’s sexual escapades with her. This is inhuman and unacceptable to say the least, if her accounts are really true. 

We believe that as a president who should champion the protection of women, it is unforgivable that he is the person who is being alleged to be at the forefront of abusing a woman using state officials who should rather be working hard to protect the citizenry, solve the numerous armed robberies and security challenges facing our country. 

Social media is awash with receipts of alleged private chats President Akufo-Addo has had with Serwaa Broni. As if that is not enough, Serwaa Broni has also stated that our Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia was involved in negotiating compensation in an effort to cover up such heinous conduct by President Akufo Addo.

We call on all women’s groups and human rights organizations in Ghana and beyond to speak up against such abuse of women by people in authority.

We would also like to appeal to the minister for gender, women and children affairs to investigate this matter just as the NDC minority Caucus in Parliament has decided to do. 

Finally, we call on President Akufo Addo to do the needful by responding to Serwaa Broni's and clear the air on these allegations that have brought so much shame and embarrassment upon our beloved country, Ghana."
