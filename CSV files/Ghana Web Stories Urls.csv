In a chat on ‘Daily Hustle Worldwide,’ Stephen mentioned that he made $2200 in Israel. However, his friend advised him to join him in Germany because he makes more for the same job. Stephen added that he did not anticipate lies from his friend and failed to confirm.  

“I’ll give Israel a 100% and Germany 50% in terms of hustle because we all leave our home country for greener pastures.”

Stephen revealed that he built a house within two years of work in Israel because he could save more compared to Germany. According to him, the cost of living and taxes in Germany is more than in Israel. 

“I stayed in Israel for three years, and within the first three months, I sent money back home to purchase a land,” he told DJ Nyaami.

Speaking on why he left a relatively better country for Europe, Stephen disclosed that his friend persuaded him to join him there.

“What he told me was very different from what I am experiencing here. He told me that he makes more than the $2200 (GHs16K) I was making in Israel. I did not find out from anyone else because I trusted him. I regret it, but I believe everything happens for a reason,” he said on SVTV Africa. 

Stephen stated that his salary in Germany after the first month discouraged him. According to Stephen, he works for the same number of hours, but he makes 1200 Euros (GHs10k) monthly."

According to him, whites are ‘gods’ who need to be worshipped. 

In a chat on SVTV Africa, Mr. Annan mentioned that he sees white people as ‘gods’ because “the devil you know is better the angel you don’t know.” Mr. Annan indicated that they migrated from Libya in 1988 with no one to host him in Italy.

“If I see a white person on my way to church, I’ll go back home because I have seen Jesus. You will never get everything perfect in life, and we’ve heard a lot about them, but they care.

""They listened to us, accepted us, and gave us a place to stay. Later in 1990, they gave us a permit to stay,” he revealed.

Mr. Annan further lauded Italians as the best people in Europe. According to him, people pay large sums of money for permits, but they never get them.

“However, it is difficult to get certain jobs in Italy as a black person. If a position is vacant, they will wait till they find a white Italian. That’s why I moved my family to the UK in 2014,” he added. 

The father of five also shared his journey in the UK and how satisfying it has been living in England."

In a chat on Daily Hustle Worldwide on SVTV Africa, Samuel explained that the agent had gotten back from Malaysia, praising the Asian country. However, it was nothing like he said. 

“The agent said the job I will do is wash cars, and they'll pay $50 to $60. He showed me his visa, and he stayed here for four years, but he could not do anything for him, then he came back as an agent.

""When I got here, the company collapsed long ago. I had to do something for myself even though my expectations were not met,” he narrated. 

Moreover, Mr. Adu mentioned that his Ghanaian host in Malaysia gave him bad advice. According to Him, it limited his chances of getting a better job in the first two years.

“I worked as a laborer because that is what most Ghanaians here do. But I decided to change my job. It helped me (financially). Malaysia is very much like Ghana, but it is more developed.”

Speaking on residence permits in Malaysia, Mr. Adu mentioned that immigration does not issue such permits to blacks. However, some people have work permits, and they renew them yearly. 

Samuel has been in Malaysia for 11 years and is the president of the Ghana Association for Non Professionals in Malaysia."

In a chat on Daily Hustle Worldwide, Kusiwaa indicated that she began her journey from South Africa before settling in Israel. According to her, despite her little success in SA, she decided to migrate for better job opportunities.

Speaking on documentation for migrants, Kusiwaa mentioned that Israeli immigration gives work permits to anyone who seeks refuge in the country. However, the immigration can scrap off the work permit anytime without prior notice. 

As a result, Madam Kusiwaa planned to work and build a home for herself and her children before she moves back to Ghana.

“If you are lucky, you can stay for six years before the permit is terminated. So I bought land for GHs20k after three months of working. It’s been three years, and I have built and roofed a ten-bedroom in Ghana.

""I do not want to live a flashy life here because you can’t go home and come back again. If they cancel my permit, I know I have a home to go to,” Kusiwaa said. 

The mother of four added that they do not rely on the work permit because it is not secure. Kusiwaa mentioned that there are many well-paying jobs in Israel. However, most of them are menial."
